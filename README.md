HW4-Problem2
============
At n = 15: The histogram has plotted the frequency at 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13, and 14.
EX: number of primes congruent to 13 (mod 15) = number of primes congruent to (15-13 = 2) (mod 15)

Conjecture: The number of primes congruent to a (mod n) is equal to the number of primes congruent to (n-a) (mod n).


At n = 14: The histogram has plotted the frequency at 1, 3, 5, 9, 11, 13.
EX: number of primes congruent to 11 (mod 14) = number of primes congruent to (14-11 = 3) (mod 14)

At n = 18: The histogram has plotted the frequency at 1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17.
EX: number of primes congruent to 17 (mod 18) = number of primes congruent to (18-17 = 1) (mod 18)

General Conjecture: Let x = (the number of primes congruent to a) mod n.
                    Then x = (the number of primes congruent to (n - a)) mod n.
